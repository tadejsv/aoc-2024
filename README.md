# AOC 2024

Advent of Code 2024 - in Python, C++ and Go. I decided to do in in all 3 languages that I know this year, to strengthen my knowledge of all 3 languages.

I also planned to try out C++ modules (in particular, `import std;`), but it doesn't seem like conda's libc++ have packaged it properly :(
